### (Track 1) Multi-Objective Optimization for AI Trustworthiness in Tabular Data Classification

This repo have the code for the UCL AI Society and Holistic AI Hackathon 2024. The goal of this project is to develop a multi-objective optimization algorithm to improve the trustworthiness of AI models in tabular data classification tasks. The algorithm will optimize the model's performance and fairness simultaneously.

#### Datasets and Tasks

- Bank Marketing Dataset: The primary goal when working with the Bank Marketing dataset is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, based on the input features from the dataset;

- Minimum Wage Dataset: The primary goal of analyzing the Minimum Wage dataset is to predict whether a workerâ€™s average income falls above or below five times the minimum wage threshold;

- Compas Dataset: The primary goal of analyzing the Compas dataset is to predict whether a defendant will re-offend within two years, based on the input features from the dataset;


### (Track 2) Building Trustworthy Models for Stereotype Classification in Text Data

(Track 2) Building Trustworthy Models for Stereotype Classification in Text Data

This track focuses on creating ethical and trustworthy AI systems for detecting stereotypes in text data. Participants will work with the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD) to classify text as containing stereotypes, being neutral, or unrelated, while addressing key ethical considerations:

Datasets and Tasks:

- Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD): Contains text annotated for stereotypes across multiple dimensions (e.g., race, gender, profession). Classify text as stereotype, neutral, or unrelated.
