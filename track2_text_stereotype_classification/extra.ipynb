    "## SAGEDbias Scraping Tutorial\n",
    "Let's walk through this SAGEDbias tutorial to understand how to **scrape relevant sentences** using the Scraper in the SAGEDbias library. The scraped materials can help you **create a dataset** to train and detect stereotypes. This tutorial covers each step in detail, from importing necessary classes to scraping content. You will first learn to initiate keywords manually and locate and scrape from Wikipedia pages. Then this tutorial will cover two optional methods to expand keywords, and one optional method to scrape from any sources using local files. \n",

    "### Summary and Working directions\n",
    "This tutorial showcased the use of the **SAGEDBias** library to define topics, locate relevant sources, and extract content. Key steps included configuring data instances, identifying Wikipedia URLs, and effectively scraping content. Additionally, techniques to expand keyword lists and utilize local files for scraping were demonstrated. This workflow equips you with a robust foundation for leveraging SAGEDBias to collect bias-related sentence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset for training stereotype detection classifiers, consider the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify sources, such as **books** and **websites**, that contain stereotypical texts, and scrape content directly from them.\n",
    "2. Use a combination of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or other advanced techniques to create synthetic models capable of generating stereotypical texts for scraping. For instance, the model [gpt2-EMGSD](https://huggingface.co/holistic-ai/gpt2-EMGSD) on Hugging Face is a GPT-2 model trained on half of the EMGSD dataset, and it can serve as an example.\n",
    "3. Utilize the **Assembler** and **Generator** modules in SAGEDBias to generate stereotypical sentence continuations or question responses using AI models.\n",
    "4. Consider exploring the definition of stereotypes and defending a particular interpretation. For example, refer to [Defining Stereotypes and Stereotyping](https://academic.oup.com/book/39792/chapter-abstract/339890364?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) for a detailed discussion on the topic.\n",
